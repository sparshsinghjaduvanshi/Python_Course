'''Hybred inheritance is a combination of multiple and single inheitance in oop
    it is a type of inheritance in which inheritance is used to inherit the properties
    of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is 
    used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.'''

'''in Python ,it can be implemented by creating a class hieararchy,in which
    a base class is inherited by multiple derived classes,and one of the derived
    classes is further inherited by a sub-derived class.'''

# syntax:-
# class baseclass:
#     pass
# class derived1(baseclass):
#     pass
# class derived2(baseclass):
#     pass
# class derived3(derived1.derived2):
#     pass

#HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE
'''it is a type of inhertance in oop where multile subclasses inherit from
    a single case class .In other words ,a single base class acts as a parent
    class for multiple subclasses.This is a way of establishing relationshps between
    classes in a heirarchical manner.'''
